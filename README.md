Develo DAO

A DAO-governed social platform where developers pitch ideas, form teams, and secure funding—all on-chain.

Core Features
DAO-Centric "Groups"

Smart Contract DAOs: Each startup/idea is a DAO (canister) with programmable governance (e.g., token-weighted voting for funding decisions). Integrate ICP’s Network Nervous System (NNS)-like framework for proposals and voting.

NFT-Based Membership: Use NFTs to represent equity or voting rights in a startup DAO. Inspired by ntagle’s NFC-physical binding hackathon winner.

Investment Mechanisms

Multi-Chain Funding: Leverage ICP’s Chain Fusion to accept investments in BTC (via ckBTC), ETH, or ICP tokens. Enable automatic dividend distributions via smart contracts.

Milestone-Based Escrow: Funds are released only when DAO-approved milestones (e.g., MVP completion) are met, using ICP’s autonomous canister timers.

Social Layer with Incentives

Tokenized Engagement: Reward users with governance tokens (like DSCVR’s model) for upvoting projects, providing feedback, or referring investors.

Decentralized Reputation: Implement a vetKeys-backed system to verify credentials (e.g., GitHub activity) without exposing private data.

VC Matchmaking

AI-Powered Matching: Build an on-chain AI agent (using ICP’s HTTPS outcalls) to analyze startup proposals and connect them with relevant VCs from ICP’s alliance network.

Fully On-Chain Frontend

Host the entire platform on ICP (no AWS dependency), ensuring censorship resistance. Use Internet Identity for seamless Web2-like logins
